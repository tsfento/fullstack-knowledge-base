# Understanding Dynamic Components
01. Using dynamic components means that the component is not always present
02. Just when something specific happens in the code
03. ngIf is the key here
04. ngIf controls whether a component is added to the DOM
05. The alternative is Dynamic Component Loader, but it is not used anymore
