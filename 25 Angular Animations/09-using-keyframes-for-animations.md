# Using Keyframes for Animations
01. You can add a keyframes method in the second argument of animate
02. keyframes must be imported form angular/animations
03. It takes an array where you can specify different styles
04. By default all the styles have the same timing
05. You can change this behavior by adding an offset to the style
06. offset would be from 0 to 1 with 0 being the start of the transition
