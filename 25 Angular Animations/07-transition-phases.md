# Transition Phases
01. You can pass the style method in the second argument of animate
02. This allows you to have more fine control of the animation
03. You can also pass an array in the second argument
04. There you can define multiples of animate and style
05. style with a property by itself will happen instantly
06. animate(time), style({styles}) will animate over time
07. animate by itself will transition to the end with the time it was passed
