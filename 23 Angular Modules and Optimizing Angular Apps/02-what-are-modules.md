# What are Modules?
01. Modules are ways of bundling angular building blocks together
02. Components, directives, services and pipes
03. They are used to tell angular what components you have
04. They are analyzed by angular to "understand" your app and its features
05. An app requires at least one module but may be split into multiple modules
06. Core angular features are included in modules to load them only when needed (FormsModule)
07. You can't use a feature/building block without including it in a module
