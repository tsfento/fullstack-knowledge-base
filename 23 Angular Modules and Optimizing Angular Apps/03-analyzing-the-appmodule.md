# Analyzing the AppModule
01. We already use mutliple modules in the recipe app
02. AppModule and AppRoutingModule
03. We also import other angular modules in AppModule
04. We only outsourced the routes to AppRoutingModule to keep AppModule cleaner and leaner
05. Every module works on its own
06. They don't communicate with each other
07. They can export and import other modules, though
