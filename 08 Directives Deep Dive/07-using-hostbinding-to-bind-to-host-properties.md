# Using HostBinding to Bind to Host Properties
01. There is an even easier way than using the renderer to change the background color in a directive
02. HostBinding can bind a value to a property
03. You pass a string of the property of the host element you want to bind
04. @HostBinding('style.backgroundColor) backGroundcolor: string;
05. this.backgroundColor = 'blue';
