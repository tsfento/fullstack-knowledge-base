# Property Binding vs String Interpolation
01. You can replace string interpolation with data binding
02. <p>Test</p> could be replaced with <p [innerText]="Test"></p>
03. If you just want to display some text, use string interpolation
04. If you want to change some property, use binding
05. Don't mix the two, so no {{ }} around property bind
