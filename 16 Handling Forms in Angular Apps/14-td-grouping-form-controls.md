# TD: Grouping Form Controls
01. ngModelGroup will group data from inputs
02. You must set a name for the group
03. ngModelGroup="userData"
04. userData will now be an object holding the values of the inputs in the group
05. This also adds validity checks like angular classes to the group of inputs
06. You can also get access to the object by setting a local reference to ngModelGroup
07. #userData="ngModelGroup"
