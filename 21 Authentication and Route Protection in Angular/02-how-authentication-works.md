# How Authentication Works
01. When a user submits their username and password, authentication data is sent to the server for validation
02. Must abstracted away from the user for security
03. Traditional webapps would use sessions, but angular is an SPA and doesn't "load" other pages
04. RESTful APIs are stateless
05. Sessions can't be used because the server and client are decoupled
06. With angular, the server will validate and send the client a json token
07. The token is an encoded string containing metadata
08. The token is generated by algorithm on the server
09. The client stores the token and attaches it to requests to the server
